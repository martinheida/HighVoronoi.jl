# HighVoronoi.jl new version 1.4.2 - Important performance patches & parallel computing bugfix!!
A Julia Package for parallelized computing of high dimensional (i.e. any dimension >= 2) Euclidean and Spherical Voronoi Meshes and setting up Finite Volume computations on these Meshes. Also allows parallelized convex hull computation.

Refer to the manual for detailed information on how to use.

The new version 1.4.0 provides spherical meshes and convex hull computation.  
The new version 1.3.0 has improved performance due to new internal data structure and parallelization.
