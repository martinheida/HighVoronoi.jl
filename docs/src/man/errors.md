# Known sources of errors
We summarize the major sources of errors so the user is aware of them:
- inserting points into the grid that are outside of the prescribed domain. This will cause in the best case weird verteces that do not exist or it will crash the algorithm. However, since the algorithm allows for unbounded domains, this is easy to prevent.
- The calculation of verteces is precise and reproduceable for regular grids. However, for irregular grids in $d>5$ , problems emerge, mostly with a relyable distinction between true neighbors and adjacents. You may get best volume and integration results using the `VI_MONTECARLO` integrator. This will be fixed in the next version.
- The algorithm can easily deal with verteces that have more than $d+1$ generators and still run stable. However, if a vertex $\nu$ is generated by $k>d+1$ cells (nodes) in high dimensions the cost to calculate all edges emerging at $\nu$ goes with the binomial $\left(\begin{array}{cc}d \\ k\end{array}\right)$. A better and much faster solution is WIP. 
- Due to the last topic, always use the `periodic_grid=(...,fast=true)` setting for PERIODIC grids in high dimension or the calculation may take hours or even days.
